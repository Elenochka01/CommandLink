### Project Description
This project consists of a simple Selenium automation script in Java. Due to time constraints, the implementation is basic but functional. The script automates the process of testing the "Careers" section. The **Thread.sleep** method was used only for visual validation to ensure that every step is clearly visible in the recorded video. The video is also attachedâ€”please check it out.
